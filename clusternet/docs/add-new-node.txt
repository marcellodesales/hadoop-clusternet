 1. Set up Hudson
 2. Go to Hudson controller (running on hadoop master) and add new hudson node
    -> Manage Hudson -> Manage nodes -> New Node
    -> Add the name of the Hadoop Slave like "Hadoop_Cluster_Slave_cu064".
    -> Add the values 1, 1 as the number of tasks, Enter "/u1/hudson" for the
FS  directory.
    -> Save it... The slave server shows as Disconnected.
    -> Go to the server cu064, for instance, and do the following:
       * Download the slave.jar to be executed in the slave: 
            wget http://cu093.cloud.sp.collab.net:9797/jnlpJars/slave.jar
       * Execute the slave as follows: 
            sudo java -jar slave.jar -jnlpUrl http://cu093.cloud.sp.collab.net:9797/computer/Hadoop_Cluster_Slave_cu064/slave-agent.jnlp  &
    -> Go to the Master and reload the list of Nodes, confirming the slave is
connected.
 
 3. On the hudson master run the "Add node"
